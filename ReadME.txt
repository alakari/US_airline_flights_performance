This project utilize an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Theia (an open source IDE platform similar to VS Code) to develop and run Python code. 

To launch the lab, check the box below (next to I agree to use this tool responsibly), and then click on the Open Tool button. This will open a new browser tab with the Cloud IDE (running on Skills Networks Labs envrionrment). 
Once the lab environment initializes, follow the instructions in the left pane of the Cloud IDE and execute them on the right side. - Open Theia IDE via this link
